# Pods
* Smallest unit of deployment
* Grouping of containers with a common purpose that runs within a node
* Can't be accessed directly because it might not be in a good state
* Not used in production alone.  Used in conjunction with a Deployment
* An example of a pod with multiple containers:
    * Microservice Container
    * Logger (Sidecar)
    * Event Publisher (Sidecar)

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:    
      # referenceable name for networking or other containers within the pod
    - name: client 
      image: stephengrider/multi-client
      ports:
        # Port exposed to the outside world
        # Can't be changed after deployed
        - containerPort: 3000
```

# Service
* Sets up networking in a Kubernetes Cluster
* Subtypes:
    - ClusterIP - 
    - NodePort - exposes a port to the outside world.  Good only for development.
    - LoadBalancer
    - Ingress

## NodePort Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: client-node-port
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:    
    - port: 3050 # Port that another Pod or another container within a Pod can use to connect to the target port
      targetPort: 3000
      # Port accessible by the outside world.  Randomly assigned if not specified.
      nodePort: 31515
  selector:
    component: web
```

# Deployment
- Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number exists

```
